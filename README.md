# NodejsMVC

## Overview

NodejsMVC is a starter project for building web applications using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with Node.js and Express.js. This structure helps you organize your app into clear, manageable sections—making it easier to scale and maintain. The repository is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand or implement the MVC pattern in Node.js.

## Features

- Organized MVC folder structure (models, views, controllers)
- Express.js for fast and flexible server development
- Easy integration with templating engines like EJS or Pug
- Static file serving via the `public` directory
- Sample routes and controllers for quick scaffolding

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (bundled with Node.js)

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikramkumarsfe/NodejsMVC.git
   cd NodejsMVC
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```

## Running the Project
